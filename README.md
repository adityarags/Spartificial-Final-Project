### Attempt 1
Noticed that the original shape of the image is 480 x 720, but the original notebook was resizing the image to 256 x 256. By reducing the size of the image, many features in the image are lost. This is why I changed the height and width of the image to the original image's height and width.  
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Image Height = 480
2. Image Width = 720

**Notes:**
In only 5 epochs, it seems to have lower score than the original notebook.

---

### Attempt 2
Since the number of epochs is too low, tried increasing the number of epochs to 10 to check for improvement.

**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Epochs = 10

**Notes:**
Increasing the epochs have shown improvements in the model's `val_iou_score`.

---
### Attempt 3
Decreasing the batch size to 8 in order to have the model train on more images on each epoch. Increased the number of epochs to 20 to check the effect.  
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Batch Size = 8
2. Epochs = 20

**Notes:**
Decreasing the batch size does create a noticeable improvement in the model's `val_iou_score`.

---
### Attempt 4
Transfer learning using VGG16 model: Since the traditional method of manually creating tensorflow layers and building a UNet seems to result in lower val_iou_scores, we can try incorporate Trasfer learning using the VGG16 pretrained model.  
Since the VGG16 model accepts only square images as input, input image shape was changed to (480, 480, 3).  
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Batch Size = 8
2. Epochs = 20
3. Image Height = 480
4. Image Width = 480
5. Activation: 'softmax'
6. Loss:'categorical_crossentropy'
7. Optimizer: Adam
8. encoder_weights: imagenet

**Notes:**  
Transfer learning has definitely improved the `val_iou_score` of the model, but the score fluctuates a lot.

---
### Attempt 5
Adjusting the learning rate in order to lower the fluctuation in `val_iou_score`.  
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Learning Rate = 5e-5
2. Epochs = 15

**Model History:**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59119736/202862099-e1041219-a2e1-47cf-b622-43d68490fdc8.png)

**Notes:**
The model's `val_iou_score` seems to come down quickly after reaching a large value. This could be because we are training the model with too many images in each epoch.

---
### Attempt 6
Adjusting the batch size to 16 to reduce overfitting.  
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Batches = 16

**Model History:**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59119736/202876509-1d945b85-d126-4d2f-bc31-32dcbafca36a.png)

**Notes:**
Overfitting seems to have been reduced, but the `val_iou_score` of the model fluctuates a lot. This may be because the optimizer is not controlled by proper parameters. 

---
### Attempt 7
Changing the optimizer to RMSprop to try to control the fluctuations in the model's `val_iou_score`. 
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.RMSprop(lr)

**Model History:**  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59119736/202887206-a5e8db1f-271d-41d9-9f22-3bed4cec3aef.png)

**Notes:**
The model's `val_iou_score` seems to get stable at 0.939 with higher epochs.

---
### Attempt 8
Trying to decrease the number of epochs to check if model stabilizes at 0.939  `val_iou_socre`.  
**Parameters Updated:**  
1. Epochs = 10
**Model History:**

**Notes:**
The model's `val_iou_score` is stable even in lower epochs.
